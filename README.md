# BrisJS Mongoose Presentation

This project showcases some of the features of mongoose ranging from beginner crud to advanced.

If you are going over it the best way to explore the project is through the tests. Clone the repository, cd to the directory and run

```
npm install
```

To run the tests run

```
npm test
```

If you attended in the evening and was wondering what I was using to run the presentation and the tests, check out Webstorm. Once in webstorm you can create a Mocha runner in the top right hand corner of the program, select the test file and just click run.
